/// A map of possible out-of band callbacks related to the parent operation.

/// Each value in the map is a [PathItem] Object that describes a set of

/// The key value used to identify the path item object is an
/// expression, evaluated at runtime, that identifies a URL to use for the
/// callback operation.
///
/// To describe incoming requests from the API provider independent from another
/// API call, use the [Document.webhooks] field.
